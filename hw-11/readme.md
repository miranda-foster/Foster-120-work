# Classes and Interactions

* I really struggled with this one. I wanted to randomize color along with appearance of the "flies",
but I couldn't get the code to work either with the color command before/in the class command.

* I tried to work on my own to first create the code, but I ended up modifying the bubble code example.
* Takeaway: this is a function I'm going to need to work on moving forward.
