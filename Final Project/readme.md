# Finally Final Final Project


# Outlook
The part I enjoy the most about using tech as an art medium is the manipulation of both color and geometric properties
on the canvas. Although I'd never used tech to create before this class, the tool fits right with my artistic style.
Going into the final project of this class, I was looking more toward making an interactive color-scape than a 'game'
or character sketch. I wanted to focus on the randomizing functions and strings after struggling with them through the semester.

# Steps
I began by looking through some of the examples from past students, and in all honesty, it was more daunting than encouraging.
I thought it might be nice to add audio to my sketch, but I struggled to figure out how to set time constraints, shortening the audio
clip, and timing it to my sketch.
My first sketch included generated ellipses that moved from one-side of the screen to the next. I wanted to work with arrays, but when I
started to add the second element of multi-colored triangles, the code failed for the ellipses.
Plan B--> I changed my focus to tracking the multi-colored triangles with the mouse and leaving the ellipses as a secondary component.
I set up the code to include several triangles tracking to the same point, and colorized them all with different values.
The sketch was very bland.
So, I went on a deep dive into the p5 reference page to learn more about colors.
I tried using HSBa color values, which allows the hue, saturation and brightness to be tinkered alongside the alpha value. What I found was
that I could change the opacity of the color for each object in my sketch for an almost holographic effect.
Most of the time spent on this project was in tinkering with color and position for the triangles. I was looking to create a symbolic landscape,
but in the end, I'd reached a point where I needed to stop tinkering or risk ruining the work I'd done.
If you aren't careful, too much color will get the better of you.

# Frustrations
1. Unfortunately, I feel like the code doesn't reflect what properties I was trying to express. The opacity increases too quickly and
overwhelms the sketch.
2. Functionality. What purpose would this code serve? It's nice to look at for about 30 seconds before losing its allure.

# Reflection
Although the project had a few flaws, I feel pretty good about my compilation of work from this semester.
I'd never imagined these to be the type of projects that would come out of an intro coding class. I didn't know anything about coding when I signed
up for the course--- I didn't even know the difference between languages, or a web browser from a web server. I was amazed by how the process would
draw me in for hours, especially when I wasn't completely committed to the discipline when I first started.

I truly enjoyed getting a taste of creative coding this semester. I'm not typically a student with the University of Montana; in fact,
I'm a Geophysics major at Pomona College in Southern California. I came home for the fall semester to be with my family and help out while we deal
with an illness. Because of my current situation at home, my assignments were not always in on time, but I'm very grateful for the opportunity to learn
something I otherwise would've missed had I not been called home this fall!
