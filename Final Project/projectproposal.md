After browsing the p5 community board, there are a few themes that repeatedly snagged my eye:
1. 3D sketches
2. Interactive mouseclick to color changes
3. Games, like the snake game.

I would like to create a sketch that acts like a puzzle, possibly where one can reveal words or certain shapes upon clicking different locations within the window. My main goal is to make the project aesthetically pleasing, over making a "game".

Deadlines:
Due by the 11th.
This is not a sarcastic answer in the slightest! I am home this semester because of a family illness, and although I love this class and the material, if something comes up, my priorities are with my family! I would like to polish the project in the last week before the due date.
