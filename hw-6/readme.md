### Week 6
## Steps
*I read through this week's lecture several times, looked up many examples on
the internet, and tried to write out code in my notebook before I tried using math
in p5 myself.
*Next, I played around with the new tools before settling on a design I liked--
I couldn't quite figure out how to fit some elements into my sketch, but Khan Academy
is proving to be a very rich resource.

## The Takeaway
*I'm amazed by some of the work my fellow classmates are producing. It's hard to
read code when the variables are so unique to whomever wrote the code, but that
is reflective of the fact that programming is art! (Hopefully that doesn't sound
too unoriginal.)
*I need to work on color randomizing this week.
