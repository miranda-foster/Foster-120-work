# HW 7 | Describe then Alter the Bouncing Ball

## Description of What the Original Code is Doing
The first ten lines of code define the variable object, 'ball'.
Next, the sketch and canvas are set up with a white background in lines thirteen through sixteen.
The looping draw function in line nineteen commands that the code repeat and 'draw' itself, and line twenty-one modifies what is drawn by changing the x-value of the ball over time based on the positional x-value .
Line twenty-two modifies the y-value of the ball based on positional y-value.
In lines twenty-five to thirty-one, a conditional statement is created that if the x-value of the ball is greater than the width of the canvas or less than 0, the position should move opposite the x-direction, and if the y-value is greater than the height of the canvas or less than 0, the position should move in the opposite y-direction.
Lines 33 to 35 create the ellipse, the ball's fill and ends the draw function.
Lines 38-41 creates a mousePressed function.
The angle of the ball's x-value is changed basedon the x-location of the mouse when pressed, and the angle of the ball's y-value is changed based on the y-location of the mouse when pressed.

## How did you alter the sketch?

I changed the canvas size to fit the window, the background color, ball size and starting location. Then I randomized the color of the ball fill and changed the effect on angle and speed of the ball when the mouse is clicked.
