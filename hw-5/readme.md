### Week 5 Recap
# Struggles
*  I spent a lot of time making tiny adjustments and subsequently reloading
my browser to understand what I was changing. I found myself getting a little
lost if I tried to return to and edit an element higher up in my document. I'm
hoping that with time I'll be able to minimize the number of reloads between
typing code because I'll be able to visualize the canvas in my head.
# Victories
* I had a lot of fun playing with hex colors. I think I like using that format
more than RGB at the moment because it seems a little more simple.
* I have used Maple software in the past, so defining variables is a familiar
concept for me and I found comfort in that after having spent many hours feeling
utterly confused.
