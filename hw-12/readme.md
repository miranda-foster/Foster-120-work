# Object Interactions

*I chose to include a mouse click interaction as well as object interaction in this week's sketch.
** Difficulties:
- I wanted to have both small and large ellipses bounce off one another, but adding a second ball check was difficult. The code is in my sketch, but it's hard to tell if it is working or not.
- I tried to include a function to splice the smaller balls with the larger bubbles, but it ended up splicing all the small balls at once.
