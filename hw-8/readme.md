## Week 8 Homework

 *  I had trouble understanding where the loop function began and how to end the command.
* I would've liked to change the direction and add different colors, but I've had a bit of a time gap due to a family emergency so I'm going to need to recap colors for next week.

# I still love the material. I have a notebook with all class notes in it.
