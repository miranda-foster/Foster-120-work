### Week 4
## Miranda Foster
* This week's work helped me to finally understand why we need
so many copies of the same files. I couldn't get my index.html link to work at
first, until I realized that my hw-4 folder was lacking the p5_lib data. Success!
* Creative coding is requiring that I relearn how to visualize the coordinate
plane. It's one thing to have gridlines when putting together shapes into a self
portrait, but when just working with the coding window, creating the most simple
drawing takes a lot longer than the finished product seems to deserve. I really
enjoyed the process after a few hours of frustration.
